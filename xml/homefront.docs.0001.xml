<p>Mexican Nationals are being released from beet and potato harvest and can be used for corn husking. They are, in general, hard workers and with little training and supervision can learn any farm job, according to I. E. Lindstrom county Agricultural Agent in Fillmore county.</p>

<p>Although the Mexicans have never picked corn as it is done here in Nebraska they are used to working with their hands which gives them an advantage over most unskilled workers.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindstrom says that separate housing is not necessary. The Mexicans have been found to be cleaner and more courteous than most transient domestic workers. Although in the work agreement they will do their own cooking it is recommended that they be given their meals as they will be better fed and able to put more hours in the field. They like American food when it is properly cooked by American cooks.</p>

<p>It is <sic corr="advisable">advisible</sic> to put more than on Mexican on a farm since very few of them speak English. They appreciate any attention given by employer, county agent or labor assistant. They, like any other worker, needs to go into town at least once a week.</p>

<p>Fillmore county will probably use about 12 or 15 Mexican Nationals, which will be secured through the county labor organization. Other corn pickers and custom workers from out of state will be available at a later date.</p>
