<p>In order that you might have information in regard to the wheat harvest in Oklahoma, we have secured the following statements from the War Manpower Commission of Oklahoma. This material is being furnished only for your information and does not constitute an order for workers. If it should become necessary for Kansas to send harvest laborers into Oklahoma, such orders will be transmitted direct to the local United States Employment Service offices and they in turn will transmit these orders to the volunteer farm placement representatives and county agents.</p>

<list>
<item>Scoopers, truck and tractor drivers, $3.00 to $7.00 per day, plus board and room.</item>
<item>Combine operators, $5.00 to $10.00 per day, plus room and board.</item>
</list>

<p>Workers interested in coming to Oklahoma should report to one of the following U.S.E.S local offices for assignment:</p>
