<figDesc>When Oklahoma City Kiwanis club members go to the cotton fields Friday, this is to remind them that they wont stand as comfortably as this. The picture shows Gov. Sidney Osborn of Arizona, allegedly picking cotton. But in Oklahoma, you have to bend over and get it and you drag that sack behind.</figDesc>

<head type="main">60 Kiwanians to Pick Cotton;<lb/>Banker to Be Water Boy</head>

<p>SIXTY members of the Oklahoma City Kiwanis club will put aside their chores Friday and go to the field to pick cotton&#8211;for one afternoon.</p>

<p>Many of the city men never have laid a finger on a boll of cotton, never have felt the dragging weight of a seven-foot cotton sack at the end of a row, but the club's offer to go to the country and help the rural brethren gather the stable was promptly accepted, due to the shortage of farm labor.</p>

<p>Scene of the Kiwanis expedition into a new realm of war service will be the Goff farm near Jones, a field estimated to yield nearly a bale per acre.</p>

<p>The city men's goal of the afternoon is 2,000 pounds, or one and a half bales, to be paid for at the going rate of $1.50 per 100 pounds. The funds will be pooled and given to one o the club's charities.</p>

<p>OFFERS of wagers, however, that the 60 men wouldn't pick even a half-bale in the afternoon, found no takers.</p>

<p>The city pickers will leave the capitol at 1 p.m. and drive to the farm, there to be directed by a loud speaker set up by George Goff, sheriff, who also will spread a feed for his pickers at sundown.</p>

<p>The group will be headed by Marmaduke Corbyn, president of the club, but he expects to win no laurels as a cotton picker. Chief among the "experienced cotton" pickers in the club are Lonnie Allmond, Borden Milk Co.; G.R. McAlpine, fire chief; Charles Dierker, district attorney; Bert Jennings, lumberman, and Fox Wood, oil man; however, it has been 15 to 30 years since any of them have had their fingers stuck by sharp bolls.</p>

<p>Lyall Barnhart, banker, will serve as water boy.</p>
