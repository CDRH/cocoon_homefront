<p>RUBY SMITH wears snug white coveralls, a Scoach cap on her victory haircut and maybe a bigger smile than that girl they wrote the song about&#8211;"Rosie, the Riveter."</p>

<p>Ruby Smith, 723 West Washington, is a raw recruit to the army of women taking on men's jobs and as pleased a rooky as the rest of them. She wields a lubrication gun in a large local garage and infinitely prefers it to waiting on tables.</p>

<p>Unconcerned whether rushed restaurant eaters get their second cup of coffee or even their first, Ruby will stay in the automobile business, thank you. "I always was a tomboy, anyway, being raised with five brothers."</p>

<p>SHE works from 8 a. m. until 6 p. m. with Thursday afternoon and all day Sunday off. "The hours are better, the money is more and besides you have a chance for a raise in this business."</p>

<p>Ruby invaded man's territory by the simple expedient of answering an ad in the paper and she is learning the trade as she goes. "The floor manager teaches me."</p>

<p>In the lubrication life (where most good mechanics come from) she has learned how to lubricate wheels, transmission and differential, how to repack wheel springs and change oil&#8211;all mysterious maneuvers once the private concern of "grease monkeys."</p>

<p>BUT this 1942 feminine version of "grease monkey" is a far cry form the original.</p>

<p>The grease-covered floor has been replaced by immaculate tile, the oil can by a lubrication gun and the grime-covered service man by a slim girl whose overalls are barely smudged and whose lipstick is on straight.</p>
