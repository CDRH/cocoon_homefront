<byline>By PAT SULLIVAN</byline>

<p>Revised water contracts between the city and the war department and the city and th Union Pacific, which will develop in excess of $100,000 a year in water revenue for Cheyenne, awaited signatures Monday afternoon, W. A. (Pat) Norris, chairman of the city water board, announced.</p>

<p>A conference between city officials, members of the water board and post officials was scheduled for 4 p. m. Monday at Ft. Warren to finish final details on the war department contract. The Union Pacific agreement was finished last fall but could not become effective until the war department had given approval to the new terms.</p>

<p>Under the new contracts both the post and the railroad, which at the present time consume between 9 to 12 million gallons and 15 to 28 million gallons a week respectively, will pay the same rate as regular city consumers for all water used in excess of 30,000,000 gallons a year.</p>

<p>The Union Pacific has been paying a flat rate of $1,000 a month and under this contract was allowed to use all the water necessary. This arrangement began in 1924. The first water contract in 1889 allowed the railroad free water due to certain promised by the company to enlarge shops and other concessions.</p>

<p>In 1909 the war department contributed $400,000 to the expansion of the then existing water system figuring at that time that Ft. Warren would some day use $50,000 gallons of water daily, a figure which was predicated on 100 gallons per capita.</p>

<p>The army has not been compelled to pay for the water used at the post, other than thru the

$400,000 it originally advanced.</p>

<p>Work on the revised contracts began two years ago last September when Mayor Ed Warren, anticipating a strain on water facilities, appointed the water board consisting of Norris, chairman, and Fred Warren, John Loomis, Don Wageman and William E. Dinneen. The board has been working constantly since that time to effect an agreement between the railroad, the city and the post. Norris said Monday that much credit is due war department officials and Union Pacific executives who have cooperated "so splendidly" with the city in being about the agreement.</p>
