<p>Washington, Oct. 9.&#8212;(A. P.)&#8212; A 3-million-dollar housing program at Fort Warren, Cheyenne, Wyo., to accommodate approximately 10,000 men is planned for next spring by the war department, Senator O'Mahoney (Dem.) of Wyoming has been informed.</p>

<p>Gen. George C. Marshall, army chief of staff, notified O'Mahoney that the plan included removal of an unannounced destination of the First and Twentieth infantry regiments (regulars) now stationed at the post, and their replacement with National Guard units from Idaho and South Dakota.</p>

<p>The latter would be the 183d field artillery from Idaho and the 188th field artillery from South Dakota. In addition a quartermaster training center would be established with approximately 7,000 enlisted men.</p>

<p>The infantry regulars now at the post number about 3,500 men. The units to replace them under tentative plans would number about 10,000.</p>

<p>The 3-million-dollar figure on new construction for housing at the fort in connection with its expansion was an estimate, it was explained, of the amount that might be needed if the transfer of the Idaho and South Dakota units and establishment of a training center were effected.</p>

<p>Aids to the senator, who left the capital Wednesday to go to Cheyenne, said he had urged the war department in several conferences with General Marshall to select the Cheyenne post as a training site under the national defense program.</p>
