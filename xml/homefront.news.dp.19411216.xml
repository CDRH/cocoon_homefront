<p>More than twenty younger business and professional men of Denver Monday night witnessed the drill of the Colorado defense force at the state armory, East Third avenue and Logan street. Nine of them joined the organization. Others made applications and are conferring with their employers and families with intention of joining, according to Maj. Clyde E. Hill, commander of the force.</p>

<p>"This is not a Junior Chamber group, or a membership group of any organization," William V. Hodges Jr., spokesman for the group said Tuesday. "Thomas Knowles and myself decided we wanted to join, and thought it would be a good thing to get a bunch of friends and business acquaintances to go in with us.</p>

<p>"We talked it up and got the gang together Monday night."</p>

<p>The idea of a group of friends working together in a volunteer organization makes for keener interest and friendly rivalry with other groups, according to Hill. The business and professional men are being assigned to the first platoon of newly-formed C company.</p>

<p>Many other groups are interested, according to Hill, including several labor unions of the city whose members are eager to do their share in state defense. The law does not permit enlistment of defense force members in groups representing any organization, but only as individuals. More than eighty men joined the force Monday night. The organization, which before the war began had less than 200 members, now numbers between 400 and 500.</p>

<p>In addition to the original A and B companies, C and D companies have been formed, and manned and E company now is being organized. Each company is made up of approximately 100 men.</p>

<p>The nine Denver business and professional men who enlisted in the force Monday night were William V. Hodges Jr., Joseph Hodges, Charles Kendrick, Charles Delaney, George Writer, Davis Moore, Eugene Adams, Chapman Young and William F. Dickson.</p>
