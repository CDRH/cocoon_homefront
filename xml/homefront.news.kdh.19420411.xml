<head type="main">Training Women in Aircraft Sheet<lb/>Metal Work Will Start Next Week</head>

<p>Training women in aircraft sheet metal will be started in the shops building at the high school next Monday under the supervision of Howard Gorham of the state department of vocation education and Floyd Roberts, trades and industries co-ordinator at the high school.</p>

<p>Only eight women can be accommodated at the start, although approximately 25 women from over the territory indicated interest in the national defense training. The course will run approximately eight weeks, from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Some may be placed in the 2 to 9 p.m. class. Classes of men and women will be mixed.</p>

<p>All women 20 to 35 years of age who are interested should register with the state employment service immediately, said Mr. Roberts. Those with Omaha contacts such as relatives and friends will be given preference in the first group selected. Birth certificates will be required as soon as they can be obtained. Those who apply will be notified as soon as they can be accommodated, after the first eight are placed.</p>

<p>Mr. Roberts also announced a machine tool operation course for men in the 3-A military registration classification will be offered throughout the vocational education department, sponsored by the board of education, at the NYA resident project beginning Tuesday. He said men interested should register with the state employment service immediately. Cards attesting to that registration will be required on enrollment. The course will last eight weeks, six hours daily, but the precise meeting schedule will be announced Monday. Only 10 men are listed for the course. Five more can be accommodated if they enroll immediately.</p>

<p>No charge is made for either course.</p>
