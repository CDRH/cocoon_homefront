<p>Many farm implement dealers in this territory, hard hit by metal shortages, may be forced out of business unless present priorities practices are abandoned.</p>

<p>This was the word of dealers who were here Wednesday for the annual meeting of the Mid-West Implement Dealers' association, which ends Friday. Dealers from Nebraska and parts of Iowa, Colorado and Wyoming are expected here for the meet.</p>
</div1>

<div1>
<head type="sub">May Improve</head>

<p>James Wallace, Council Bluffs, veteran secretary of the organization, said that although implement manufacturers are on the preferred list, they are not getting enough metal to supply dealers' demand for implements and parts. The situation may improve now that there is actual war, he said.</p>

<p>"I believe the policy that has been followed with regard to implement manufacturers is a mistake," Wallace said. "We must realize that there must be machinery to replace men who have left farming areas. You can't win a war without food, and you must have machinery to produce food.</p>
</div1>

<div1>
<head type="sub">Steel for Autos</head>

<p>"Automobile manufacturers have been getting more steel, proportionately, than implement manufactures have. Two dealers who are attending this meeting have told me that they are going to give up and go out of business. And I presume there are others I haven't talked to who are in the same boat."</p>

<p>The question is expected to take up considerable time at the meeting, and at least two speakers are expected to discuss it. They are William C. FitzGibbon, staff assistant in the treasury department, Washington, who is to speak today, and Paul M. Milliken, executive secretary, National Farm Equipment association, St. Louis, Mo., who is scheduled to talk Friday.</p>
