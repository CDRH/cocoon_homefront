<head type="main">Women Not Afraid of Grease and Dirt<lb/>Train for Army Ordnance Depot Jobs</head>

<p>Women who aren't afraid of getting grease on their hands or dirt on their faces are being enrolled here through the civil service for training as mechanics and assignment as civilian <sic corr="employees">employes</sic> at army ordnance depots and shops.</p>

<p>First group of two hundred will be called January 29 for three months' training at the Fort Crook sub-section at Plattsmouth. When assigned, their pay will be $4 a day, out of which they will pay for barracks and food at cost.</p>

<p>There are no educational requirements of the applicants, who are interviewed by civil service personnel and given aptitude tests.</p>
</div1>

<div1>
<head type="sub">Most Are Married</head>

<p>Most of the applicants are married, many with husbands, brothers or sons in the service. Patriotism motivates most of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman Nelson, 5132 Dodge street, is typical.</p>

<p>"I am qualified as a secretary," she said, "but I thought I could do the most good in this type of work. My husband is in an officers' training school in Maryland."</p>

<p>Mrs. Howland Lake of Bedford, Ia., is the wife of a lieutenant in north Africa.</p>
</div1>

<div1>
<head type="sub">Ages 16 to 52</head>

<p>"We used to live on a farm," she said. "I think I will make a good mechanic. I want to do something."</p>

<p>Ages range from 16 to 52. One 63-year-old applied for training, and was advised against it.</p>

<p>"I can drive anything on four or eight wheels," one woman said in making her application.</p>

<p>The civil service office, 210 South Eighteenth street, room 103, is receiving applications.</p>
