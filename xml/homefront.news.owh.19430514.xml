<p>Lexington, Neb., May 13&#8211;Inspired by a patriotic desire to further the cause of the united nations, 50 Mexican farm workers from the state of Jalisco arrived in Lexington today to help hard-pressed Nebraska farmers win their food production battle. Others are expected later.</p>

<p>The men, ranging in age from 21 to 50, are a select group, all from agricultural areas and not eligible for military service. They were part of a contingent of 850 that reached Denver yesterday for distribution in Nebraska, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming and the Dakotas.</p>

<p>Imported by the farm security administration, the men are under contract to the Mexican and United States governments. They are guaranteed good food and living quarters, as well as employment at least 75 per cent of the workable days. They are paid prevailing wages for the type of work done, a certain percentage being paid direct to the worker and the rest being sent to a Mexican bank to be held until his return home.</p>

<p>The group was accompanied by W. F. Drewien of California, senior employment supervisor for the government, and by interpreter Pete Sanchez of Grand Island, an <sic corr="employee">employe</sic> of the American Beet Sugar company. Most of the men will work in beet fields.</p>

<p>Through Sanchez a number of the younger men expressed a desire to learn English. Drewien said that if classes could be arranged he was sure the Mexican government would be pleased, since a part of the plan is for the workers to take advantage of educational opportunities in this country.</p>
