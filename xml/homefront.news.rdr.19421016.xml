<p>Twenty Roswell high school boys and girls have signified their willingness to pick cotton on their holiday tomorrow to help alleviate the shortage of pickers, according to Theodore M. Schuster, manager of the local office of the U.S. Employment Service, who said he was trying to find some place for them to work where cotton sacks would be furnished.</p>

<p>One high school organization has agreed to pick cotton on some Saturday later, but can't pick tomorrow because of a meeting, Mr. Schuster said.</p>

<p>About twenty women, he said, have been obtained to pick cotton through the house to house canvass being made by the Employment Service in certain parts of town. Anyone who will help out in this work is asked to call at the Employment office in the basement of the city hall or phone 632.</p>

<p>Mr. Schuster said farmers here had agreed to furnish transportation for Navajo Indians from Gallup if enough could be recruited to come here to pick cotton and stay until the season is over, and an effort to recruit these Indians is being made, Mr. Schuster said.</p>
