<head type="sub">Dean Urges Exchange of Men and<lb/>Machines to Produce More<lb/>for War With Less</head>

<p>BELOIT, Oct. 29 (AP)&#8211;The Kansas Farmers Union was told today by its president that farmers must share both labor and machinery to produce more and more for the war with less and less. "To balance the depletion of equipment and labor supplies," said the president, E. K. Dean, "we must bring cooperation more and more into the farm picture. We must increase the exchange of labor, co-operative use of farm machinery and all other group actions."</p>

<p>Dean said all Farmers Union members and all eligible small farmers should avail themselves of the chance of becoming full time food producers through the department of agriculture's farm securities administration. Dean reported a substantial increase in the member of the organization over last year.</p>

<p>Cal Ward, former president of the Kansas Union and now regional director of the farm security administration in Kansas, Nebraska and the Dakotas, outlined the FSA work. Ward said thousands of Kansas farmers were unable to utilize their potential farm labor because of lack of equipment and operating capital for livestock and work stock and unsatisfactory farm tenure. "FSA loans and guidance can eliminate these factors," Ward said. "FSA supervisors have been instructed to make loans wherever they will help low income farms bring their production into harmony with war needs."</p>
