<p>TOPEKA, Aug. 24 (AP)&#8211;Governor Schoeppel told a group of Kansas school men today they must get ready to help <sic corr="offset">offest</sic> greater inroads the draft and war industries would make in local manpower used in food production.</p>

<p>"We'll have to buckle down as we never buckled down before in supplying man power. I believe the schools can help put more youths to work where they are needed most&#8211;on the farm," the executive declared.</p>

<p>School men and state farm equipment leaders, called together by Bert Culp of Detroit, chairman of the state farm labor commission, discussed the problem of increased labor shortages in food production and ways of recruiting school youths to relive the shortages.</p>

<p>Clifford Dean of Lawrence and Hugh Bryan of Leavenworth said they arranged school schedules to permit youths to work a half day and go to school half a day. At Syracuse, where Bryan headed the schools before going to Leavenworth this summer, outside work on farms and local industries was mandatory half of every day during critical periods.</p>

<p>Lester Pollom, head of vocational agriculture for the state board of vocational education, said he doubted if one general plan would work for all communities, but it is important "that every community have a plan."</p>
