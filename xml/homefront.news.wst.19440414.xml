<p>The Carnegie library at Cheyenne has donated several thousand pounds of obsolete books, aside from many hundred pounds of old newspapers, magazines and other periodicals to the waste paper drive, according to Mrs. Louise Patterson, librarian.</p>

<p>Mrs. Patterson emphasized that the only books which were disposed of were those that were too worn out for further use or those that contained outmoded and out-of-date information. She said the waste paper was collected by junior high school students.</p>

<p>"Important articles from magazines are photographed on microfilm, similar to that used for "V" mail, before the magazines are given to the waste paper drive. This practice of micro-filming important articles gives us a permanent record and saves much space, aside from permitting us to be of greater assistance to the waste paper program," Mrs. Paterson said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Earl Wright, state salvage chairwoman, said that "the contribution of the Cheyenne Carnegie library is not only highly commendable, but also reveals a huge source of waste paper. I hope that salvage chairwomen and chairmen and librarians will be able to work out similar plans for all the other libraries in the state, as this would materially increase Wyoming's output of this most critical item."</p>
