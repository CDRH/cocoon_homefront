<head type="main">LABOR SHORTAGE PUTTING MORE<lb/>WOMEN WORKERS UPON FARMS</head>
<milestone unit="smallbar"/>

<p>Back to the soil is apparently becoming a strong feminine movement, according to a report released yesterday by Federal Agricultural Statistician George Knutson.</p>

<p>One April 1, 1942, 13 per cent of the total farm workers in the nation were women. A year ago only 1.5 per cent of the total were women.</p>

<p>The report revealed that, despite a strong wage increase, there is a definite shortage of farms labor particularly ranch hands. The supply of workers on April 1 was 72 per cent of normal compared with a demand 110 per cent over normal.</p>

<p>Monthly wages on April 1 without board averaged $74.75 as compared with $66.50 on March 1, and $55.75 a year ago. Day rates average $3.20 on April 1, 1942, compared with $2.70 on March 1 and $2.35 on April 1, 1941.</p>

<p>A total of 26,000 persons were employed on Wyoming farms and ranches on the first of this month. Of this number 18,000 were family workers and 8,000 hired workers.</p>

<p>Throughout the United States there were 97,000 fewer persons employed on farms than a year ago, though the index of farm wage rates was 28 per cent higher.</p>
