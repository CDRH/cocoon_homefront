<head type="main">LABOR SHORTAGE IN SUGAR BEET<lb/>AND BEAN FIELDS GROWS GRAVE</head>
<milestone unit="smallbar"/>

<p>Worland, Wyo., Aug. 13.&#8211;(U.P.)&#8211;Despite emergency measures, sugar beet growers and officials of Wyoming are fearful that harvest time will find them with an inadequate supply of farm labor to handle the excellent crop.</p>

<p>Agricultural officials except some help from students who probably will be permitted to stay out of classes for some time to help in the harvest of the sugar beets, and also in the bean harvest.</p>

<p>Farmers in the northern Wyoming area also are hopeful that Japanese workers from the new Heart Mountain Relocation project at Cody may be available to work in the beet fields but camp officials emphasize that these Japanese will be very busy with their own work at the camp and that only a limited number will be available.</p>

<p>There is the possibility that Mexican labor may be moved in by federal officials to help in the situation. The state department recently announced an agreement with the Mexican government providing for importation of a certain number of Mexican workers to help in southwest and western fields.</p>

<p>W. J. Gorst, former secretary of the National Beet Growers association and resident of Worland, attended a national conference in San Francisco during the first of the week at which time the labor problem was discussed by beet growers, sugar processors and war relocation boards. The matter of conditions under which Japanese evacuee labor may be used on farms was one of the main discussion topics.</p>

<p>Topics in the Worland area voted unanimously at a recent meeting to accept Japanese labor if it were available.</p>
